                Hi! i am Specialising in Chinese Cuisine, i am stresses on the importance of using fresh ingredients
                in every dish and delighting guests with his gastronomic specialties. I made culinary debut with a
                Chinese restaurant some 30 years ago and has since moved away from a traditional approach towards an
                innovative style of cooking.

        <P> If life could only be as simple as following a recipe, we’d all be much happier. However,<br> unlike food
            based
            recipes, life doesn’t provide you with standardized ingredients as each <br> lives their unique life.

                            Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine ricotta cheese, 1/2 of the mozzarella
                            cheese,
                            Parmesan cheese, egg, and Italian seasoning in
                            a bowl.Cook sausage in a skillet over medium heat until no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes;
                            drain. Stir

                        <p>
                            Growing up, chicken schnitzel was a classic. I decided to make this dish oven-friendly using
                            less
                            oil, and an easier cleanup. This dish tastes great with potato salad, or mashed potatoes and
                            a nice
                            crisp salad. Tastes great the next day cold too! It's a family-favorite! Enjoy with fresh
                            squeezed
                            lemon juice.
